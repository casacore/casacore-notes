\section{\underbar{Purpose}}

The purpose of this document is to define the development plan for
AIPS++ release v 1.4, currently scheduled for October 31, 2000. 

\section{\underbar{Release priorities}}

The highest priority for the project at this time is scientific
completeness, and planning for release v1.4 has been undertaken in
keeping with this objective. Maintaining a sound infrastructure in the
project is important however, and infrastructure work has been
scheduled for this cycle carefully; primarily in areas which are vital
for the long-term vitality of the project, or which are in the
critical path for application development.

\section{\underbar{Introduction}}

Development priorities and targets are listed separately for each
major development area in AIPS++. These targets cover only the
development cycle through October 2000, and do not include longer-term
items, which are tracked separately for consideration in subsequent
development cycles. There are 20 weeks before the expected
code-freeze, but deductions for defect correction (20\%), user support
(up to 20\%), and where applicable, science time (25\%), have been
made. The exact numbers vary by developer and institution, and the
best estimate has been made in each case. Variability in these
estimates is accommodated by the inclusion of medium prioirty targets,
which may need to be carried over into the next cycle. Each target is
assigned a priority as high ({\bf H}), which implies that the target
is expected to be completed this cycle, and medium ({\bf M}), which is
work to be done on an as-available basis. Note also, that not all
developers are available to the project on a full-time basis, and have
reduced commitments as a result.

is of direct and immediate benefit to end-users.

\item[Calibration and imaging capabilities] The provision of
calibration and imaging capabilities which are integrated with
the synthesis infrastructure is a high priority.

\item[Support GBT commissioning] The continued development of tools
required for GBT commissioning remains a priority during this
development cycle.

\end{description}

\end{description}

%%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{\underbar{Synthesis}}

\subsection{\underbar{Priorities}}

\begin{description}

\item[Scientific completeness] Significant synthesis capabilities
exist within the package at present, but they need to be more widely
used in the scientific community. This problem can be addressed
through improved vertical integration of synthesis applications, and
in the addition of scientific completeness beyond the current
thin-path capabilities. In this area, the full completion of
connected-element capabilities takes priority over VLBI.

\item[Time-critical local priorities] It is important that the project
meet time-critical targets required for successful AIPS++ use at
consortia sites, particularly where the use of AIPS++ is closely
integrated into the critical path required for instrument use or
operation.

\item[Basic automated imaging] The synthesis infrastructure is
sufficiently developed to allow the implementation of basic automated
imaging capabilities, applicable to both off-line and real-time
imaging. It is appropriate during this development cycle to continue
initial work in this area in the main package, and to coordinate
similar developments at other consortium sites to maximize component
re-use in pipeline development.

\item[Automated testing] Expanding the automated testing of synthesis
capabilities using simulated data is a priority during this cycle,
both at the C++ and Glish level. This has benefits in speeding up
release testing, and in daily and weekly checks of system integrity
for end-users.

and glishhelp Glish components to the main package. Adjust to conform
with integration guidelines. ({\bf JN, H, 3wk}).

\end{description}

%%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{\underbar{Build and code distribution system}}

This covers all system work, excluding maintenance and support of the
basic library.

\subsection{\underbar{Priorities}}

\begin{description}

\item[Stability] A fundamental requirement in this cycle is the
continued provision of a stable build to maximize application
development and testing efficiency. The project is now operational and
build failures have a significant impact on applications development
efficiency and the ease of user support.

\item[End-user release support] With the project in an operational
phase, the provision of end-user installation and release update
support is a high priority. This includes a mechanism for assembling
release patches automatically.

\item[Initial developer support] An initial group of external
developers is starting to use the system for exploratory
development. This group can be supported in the most cost-effective
manner by starting to provide formal support for external development
on very restricted platforms in advance of the full developer's
release, which is planned for 2001.

\end{description}

\subsection{\underbar{Targets}}

\begin{description}

\item[Finish changelog implementation] Complete the implementation of
the current changelog system. ({\bf GvD, H, 1 wk}).

\item[Prepare initial developer's release] Document the makedefs, and
provide an installation FAQ for an initial developer's release,
targeted at RedHat and SuSe Linux systems of restricted version
numbers. Test the resulting CDs. ({\bf GvD, H, 2 wk}).

\item[Automated patch generation] Complete a utility to automate patch
generation by tracking library dependencies. ({\bf DS, H, 2 wk}).

\item[Implement global data proposal] Implement the existing global
data proposal using CVSup. ({\bf DS, H, 2 wk}).

\end{description}

%%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{\underbar{Glish}}

\subsection{\underbar{Priorities}}

\begin{description} 

\item[Consolidation] The work on Glish is in a stage of
consolidation. In general, Glish's capabilities are sufficient both
for developers to implement higher-level applications and for users to
explore their data. The language is also at about the right level; it
is capable enough for complex scripts, while still being approachable
by general users. The focus for this cycle will be correcting
long-standing defects, particularly in the area of memory leaks and
Glish/Tk performance, and in modest new development in Glish.

\end{description}

\subsection{\underbar{Targets}}

\begin{description}

\item[Resolve reference cycle problems] This target involves
understanding the specifics of how reference count cycles are
introduced in Glish, and in devising a general solution to this
question which avoids the memory and performance penalties of garbage
collection. Reference count cycles are believed to be responsible for
many memory leaks currently found in Glish scripts. ({\bf DS, H, 4 wk})

\item[Bind first Tix mega-widgets] This target involves the manual
binding of the tab and combo-box Tix mega-widgets to Glish/Tk. These
are immediately useful in the end-user interface. A longer-term
solution will require an automated method of making mega-widgets
available via Glish/Tk, but this work is not included in this
target. ({\bf DS, H, 2 wk}).

\item[Understand speed of TCL/Tk and Glish/Tk] There is currently a
perceived performance problem in Glish/Tk, which is especially
pronounced when drawing large GUIs. The specific origin is
unknown. This target involves determining the specific cause by direct
comparison with TCL/Tk, including investigating what fraction of the
speed differential is caused by byte-compiling. If simple remedies are
apparent short of multi-threading, this target includes their
implementation. ({\bf DS, H, 2 wk})

\item[Defect backlog] A variety of Glish defects remain which are
typically long-standing problems which have been neglected due to the
work involved in fixing them. They need attention during this
development cycle. Included in this list is an investigation of the
memory leaks which affect the GBT weather GUI. ({\bf DS, H, 4 wk}).

\item[Local eval()] The current eval() function in Glish operates only
in {\it global} scope. This target covers the implementation of a
version operating in {\it local} scope. ({\bf DS, M, 2 wk}).

\end{description}

%%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{\underbar{User interface and tasking}}

\subsection{\underbar{Priorities}}

\begin{description}

\item[Consolidation and evaluation] Views on user interfaces are
inherently subjective; a wider pool of scientific users needs to use
and comment on the current automated GUI system, as implemented in
toolmanager, before undertaking a second revision of the user
interface. This feedback needs to be actively sought, and reviewed
during this cycle. This factor, combined with the limited available
resources for toolmanager development, argues for consolidation only
during this development cycle.

\end{description}

\subsection{\underbar{Targets}}

\begin{description}

\item[Enhancement of group meta-information] Allow function membership
in multiple groups; list functions in toolmanager alphabetically
within each group; list reserved standard function names in a
pre-defined initial group. ({\bf TC, H, 0.5 wk}).

\item[Tool listing by type] Allow selection by type in the listing of
current tools in toolmanager. ({\bf TC, H, 0.5 wk}).

\item[Constructor in guientry wrench menu] Add a standard constructor
option in the guientry wrench menu. ({\bf TC, H, 1 wk}).

\item[Single tool per module shortcut] Automatically select a tool in
the toolmanager initial interface if it is the only tool in the
module, and has no global functions. ({\bf TC, H, 0.5 wk}).

\end{description}

%%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{\underbar{Basic library}}

\subsection{\underbar{Priorities}}

\begin{description}

\item[Consolidation] The basic library, which covers all fundamental
infrastructure, is mostly complete. Development in this cycle has been
scheduled in the area of library maintenance, and in the provision of
limited new capabilities required for application development.

\end{description}

\subsection{\underbar{Targets}}

\begin{description}

\item[Complete new standard storage manager] Complete the new
StandardStMan, which will be the default storage manager. ({\bf GvD -
H, 1 wk}).

\item[Increase robustness of Tables] This target involves continued
work in assessing the robustness of the Table system as currently
deployed by the TMS on the WSRT telescope, in tracking down any
problems, and in fixing them. ({\bf GvD, H, 3 wk}).

\item[Deep copy and actualDesc()] Provide additional information on
the storage manager in use and the actual table description; allow
deep copy of tables. ({\bf GvD, H, 1 wk}).

\begin{description}

\item[Coordsys editor] Add a GUI capability to make and edit a

\end{description}

%%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{\underbar{Visualization}}

This includes work in the Display Library (DL), and in applications
using this library.

\subsection{\underbar{Priorities}}

\begin{description}

\item[DL development transition] David Barnes will be leaving AIPS++
during this development cycle, and securing a smooth transition in
development in this area is a high priority. This includes training
other developers in the DL, and in distributing design knowledge of
the library more broadly.

\item[Provision of uv-visualization services] The DL has provided
excellent support of image visualization, and continuation of the
effort to expand this capability to uv-data visualization is a high
priority.

\end{description}

\subsection{\underbar{Targets}}

\end{description}

%%----------------------------------------------------------------------


\section{\underbar{Parallelization and high-performance computing}}

\subsection{\underbar{Priorities}}

\begin{description}

\item[Scientific application] The parallelization effort needs
to demonstrate a scientifically useful capability to address the most
challenging problems in radio astronomy where supercomputer resources
are required. These include wide-field imaging problems at low
observing frequencies, mosaicing and the largest VLBI observations,
amongst others. In addition, this also includes new algorithms which
have not been widely used to date due to limited computing resources.

\item[Parallelization infrastructure] A central goal of the
parallelization effort is to ensure that infrastructure is developed
within the AIPS++ system as a whole to support parallel and
distributed computing without expensive ad hoc modifications. This
requires that the parallelization infrastructure be compatible with
the overall project design, and also that the mainstream project
development consider parallelization when implementing algorithms. It
is also imperative that the parallelization capabilities be presented
using the same user interface as the conventional package.

\item[High-performance computing in AIPS++] The parallelization
effort has a strong vested interest in the serial performance of
AIPS++ for problems of the largest size, which are defined to be those
with exceptional I/O, memory or CPU requirements. It is considered the
responsibility of this group to profile the serial performance in
these specialized cases, make any changes required to support these
large problem sizes, and optimize overall serial performance in these
cases.

\end{description}

\subsection{\underbar{Targets}}

\begin{description}
