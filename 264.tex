\section{Summary} 

This note describes a revised MeasurementSet definition which extends
that previously given in casacore Note 229 (Kemball and Wieringa 2000).

\section{Introduction}

\section{Summary of changes}

This section contains a description of the changes proposed for each
table in the MS definition. A full definition of the v3.0 MS format is
given in Section~\ref{sec:layout}.

\begin{itemize}
\item Add explicit primary keys.
\item Support versioning of DATA, WEIGHTS and FLAG columns. Remove SIGMA, SIGMA\_SPECTRUM.
\item Remove FLAG\_ROW, WEIGHT columns, make spectral information (FLAG, WEIGHT\_SPECTRUM) information non-optional.
\item Formalize combinations of MeasurementSets (``Multi-MS'') for parallel processing.
\item Remove DATA\_DESC\_ID.
\end{itemize}

\section{MS v3.0 layout}\label{sec:layout}

There is a MAIN table containing a number of data columns and keys
into various subtables. There is at most one of each subtable. The
subtables are stored as keywords of the MS, and all defined sub-tables
are tabulated below.  Optional sub-tables are shown in italics.

\begin{description}
\item[Notes:]

\item Note that \nl = number of lags, \nc = number of correlators, 
\nf = number of frequency channels, and \ncat = number of flag categories.

\item[MS\_VERSION] The MeasurementSet format revision number,
expressed as $major\_revision.minor\_revision$. This version is 2.0.

\item[SORT\_COLUMNS] Sort indices, in the form "$index_1,\ index_2\
...$, for the underlying MS. A string containing "NONE" reflects no
sort order.  An example might be SORT\_COLUMNS="TIME ANTENNA1
ANTENNA2", to indicate sorting in in time-baseline order.

\item[SORT\_ORDER] Sort order as either "ASCENDING" or "DESCENDING".

\item[TIME] Mid-point (not centroid) of data interval.

\item[TIME\_EXTRA\_PREC] Extra time precision.

\item[ANTENNA$n$] Antenna number ($\geq 0$), and an index into
the ANTENNA sub-table. For $n > 2$, triple-product data are implied.

\item[FEED$n$] Feed number ($\geq 0$). For $n > 2$, triple-product
data are implied.

\item[SPECTRAL\_WINDOW\_ID] Spectral window identifier ($\geq 0$), an
index into the SPECTRAL\_WINDOW sub-table.

\item[PROCESSOR\_ID] Processor indentifier ($\geq 0$), and an
index into the PROCESSOR sub-table.

\item[PHASE\_ID] Switching phase identifier ($\geq 0$)

\item[FIELD\_ID] Field identifier ($\geq 0$).

\item[INTERVAL] Data sampling interval. This is the nominal data
interval and does not include the effects of bad data or partial
integration.

\item[EXPOSURE] Effective data interval, including bad data and
partial averaging.

\item[PULSAR\_BIN] Pulsar bin number for the data record. Pulsar data
may be measured for a limited number of pulse phase bins. The pulse
phase bins are described in the PULSAR sub-table and indexed by this
bin number.

\item[PULSAR\_GATE\_ID] Pulsar gate identifier ($\geq 0)$, and an
index into the PULSAR\_GATE sub-table. 

\item[SCAN\_NUMBER] Arbitrary scan number to identify data taken in
the same logical scan. Not required to be unique.

\item[ARRAY\_ID] Subarray identifier $(\geq 0)$, which identifies data
in separate subarrays, as defined in Section 3.3.

\item[OBSERVATION\_ID] Observation identifier $(\geq 0)$, which identifies
data from separate observations, as defined in Section 3.3.

\item[STATE\_ID] State identifier $(\geq 0)$, as defined in Section 3.1.5.

\item[BASELINE\_REF] Flag to indicate the original correlator
reference antenna for baseline-based correlators (True for ANTENNA1;
False for ANTENNA2).

\item[UVW] $uvw$ coordinates for the baseline from ANTENNE2 to ANTENNA1,
   i.e. the
   baseline is equal to the difference POSITION2 - POSITION1. The UVW given
   are for the TIME\_CENTROID, and correspond in general to the reference type
   for the PHASE\_DIR of the relevant field. I.e. J2000 if the phase reference
   direction is given in J2000 coordinates. However, any known reference is
   valid.
   Note that the choice of baseline direction and UVW definition ($W$ towards
   source direction; $V$ in plane through source and system's pole; $U$ in
   direction of increasing longitude coordinate) also determines the sign of
   the phase of the recorded data.

\item[UVW2] $uvw$ coordinates for the baseline from ANTENNE3 to ANTENNA1
   (triple-product data only), i.e. the
   baseline is equal to the difference POSITION3 - POSITION1. The UVW given
   are for the TIME\_CENTROID, and correspond in general to the reference type
   for the PHASE\_DIR of the relevant field. I.e. J2000 if the phase reference
   direction is given in J2000 coordinates. However, any known reference is
   valid.
   Note that the choice of baseline direction and UVW definition ($W$ towards
   source direction; $V$ in plane through source and system's pole; $U$ in
   direction of increasing longitude coordinate) also determines the sign of
   the phase of the recorded data.

\item[DATA, LAG\_DATA] At least one of these columns
should be present in a given MeasurementSet. In special cases one or
more could be present (e.g., single dish data used in synthesis
imaging or a mix of auto and crosscorrelations on a multi-feed single
dish). If only correlation functions are stored in the MS, then \nfs\
is the maximum number of lags (\nl) specified in the LAG table for
this LAG\_ID.  If both correlation functions and frequency spectra are
stored in the same MS, then \nfs\ is the number of frequency channels,
and the weight information refers to the frequency spectra only. The
units for these columns (eg. 'Jy') specify whether the data are in
flux density units or correlation coefficients.

\item[VIDEO\_POINT] The video point for the spectrum, to allow the
full reverse transform.

\item[SIGMA] The estimated rms noise for a single channel, for
each correlator.

\item[SIGMA\_SPECTRUM] The estimated rms noise for each channel.

\item[WEIGHT] The weight for the whole data matrix for each
correlator, as assigned by the correlator or processor.

\item[WEIGHT\_SPECTRUM] The weight for each channel in the data
matrix, as assigned by the correlator or processor. The weight
spectrum should be used in preference to the WEIGHT, when available.

\item[FLAG] An array of Boolean values with the same shape as DATA
(see the DATA item above) representing the cumulative flags applying
to this data matrix. Data are flagged bad if the FLAG array element is True.

\item[FLAG\_CATEGORY] An array of flag matrices with the same shape as
DATA, but indexed by category. The category identifiers are specified
by a keyword CATEGORY, containing an array of string identifiers,
attached to the FLAG\_CATEGORY column and thus shared by all rows in
the MeasurementSet. The cumulative effect of these flags is reflected
in column FLAG. Data are flagged bad if the FLAG array element is
True. See Section 3.1.8 for further details.

\begin{description}

\item[Notes:] This sub-table contains frame information 
for different Doppler tracking modes. It is indexed from the
SPECTRAL\_WINDOW\_ID sub-table (with SOURCE\_ID as a secondary index)
and thus allows the specification of a source-dependent Doppler
tracking reference for each SPECTRAL\_WINDOW. This model allows
multiple possible transitions per source per spectral window, but only
one reference at any given time.

\item[DOPPLER\_ID] Doppler identifier, as used in the SPECTRAL\_WINDOW
sub-table.

\item[SOURCE\_ID] Source identifier (as used in the SOURCE sub-table).

\item[TRANSITION\_ID] This index selects the appropriate line from the
list of transitions stored for each SOURCE\_ID in the SOURCE table.

\begin{description}

\item[Notes:] A feed is a collecting element on an antenna, such as a
single horn, that shares joint physical properties and makes sense to
calibrate as a single entity. It is an abstraction of a generic
antenna feed and is considered to have one or more RECEPTORs that
respond to different polarization states. A FEED may have a
time-variable beam and polarization response. 
Feeds are numbered from 0 on each separate antenna for each
SPECTRAL\_WINDOW\_ID. Consequently, FEED\_ID should be non-zero only
in the case of feed arrays, i.e. multiple, simultaneous beams on the
sky at the same frequency and polarization.

\item[ANTENNA\_ID] Antenna number, as indexed from ANTENNA$n$ in
MAIN.

\item[FEED\_ID] Feed identifier, as indexed from FEED$n$ in MAIN.

\item[SPECTRAL\_WINDOW\_ID] Spectral window identifier. A value of -1
indicates the row is valid for all spectral windows.

\item[TIME] Mid-point of time interval for which the feed parameters
in this row are valid. The same Measure reference used for the TIME
column in MAIN must be used.

\item[INTERVAL] Time interval. 

\item[NUM\_RECEPTORS] Number of receptors on this feed. See
POLARIZATION\_TYPE for further information.

\item[BEAM\_ID] Beam identifier. Points to an optional BEAM sub-table
defining the primary beam and polarization response for this FEED. A
value of -1 indicates that no associated beam response is defined.

\item[BEAM\_OFFSET] Beam position offset, as defined on the sky but in
the antenna reference frame.

\item[FOCUS\_LENGTH] Focus length. As defined along the optical axis
of the antenna.

\item[PHASED\_FEED\_ID] Phased feed identifier. Points to a
PHASED\_FEED sub-table which in turn points back to multiple entries
in the FEED table, and specifies the manner in which they are
combined. 

\item[POLARIZATION\_TYPE] Polarization type to which each receptor
responds (e.g. "R","L","X" or "Y"). This is the receptor polarization
type as recorded in the final correlated data (e.g. "RR"); i.e. as
measured after all polarization combiners.

\item[POL\_RESPONSE] Polarization response at the center of the beam
for this feed. Expressed in a linearly polarized basis $({\bf \vec
e_x}, {\bf \vec e_y})$ using the IEEE convention.

\item[POSITION] Offset of feed relative to the feed reference position
for this antenna (see ANTENNA sub-table).

\item[RECEPTOR\_ANGLE] Polarization reference angle. Converts into
parallactic angle in the sky domain.

\begin{description}

\item[Notes:] The FIELD table defines a field position on the sky. For
interferometers, this is the correlated field position. For single dishes,
this is the nominal pointing direction.

\item[NAME] Field name; user specified.

Measure type.

\item[REFERENCE\_DIR] Reference center; can be expressed as a

Measure type. Used in single-dish to record the associated reference
direction if position-switching has already been applied. For
interferometric data, this is the original correlated field center,
and may equal DELAY\_DIR or PHASE\_DIR.

\item[SOURCE\_ID] Points to an entry in the optional SOURCE subtable, a
value of $-1$ indicates there is no corresponding source defined.

\item[EPHEMERIS\_ID] Points to an entry in the EPHEMERIS sub-table,
which defines the ephemeris used to compute the field position. Useful
for moving, near-field objects, where the ephemeris may be revised over time.

matrix. These can be frequency-dependent, to accommodate instruments
such as acousto-optical spectrometers. Note that the channel
frequencies may be in ascending or descending frequency order.

channel. Although these can be derived from CHAN\_FREQ by
differencing, it is more efficient to keep a separate reference to
this information.
