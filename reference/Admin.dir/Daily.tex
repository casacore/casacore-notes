\chapter{Daily Duties}
\section{Check the build health}
A build health script runs daily reporting errors of various builds around the world.  Up to 30
errors will be displayed. Look at this report and act accordingly.  Responsibility for linux, solaris native and gnu, and sgi reside with \aipspp central.
\section{Check aips2msg}
A seperate account exists for recieving email intended for aips2mgr and aips2adm, it's called
aips2msg.  Aips2mgr and
aips2adm have no deciperable password and access is granted via ssh keys.  We also manage the
aips2 email exploders and mailman requests will come to this account and need to be dealt with
accordingly.
