\section{Summary}
A MeasurementSet is an \aipspp\ Table containing data from a telescope.
Telescopes all record data in their own way, the MeasurementSet layout
describes how these measurements are to be stored within the \aipspp\ system.
This document describes the predefined columns and keywords (including
subtables) of the MeasurementSet (MS). The predefined items include
required and optional ones.
In addition to the predefined columns, MeasurementSets can contain
instrument specific columns, keywords or subtables. These additional
items would only be accessed from instrument specific code.

\section{Details}

\begin{itemize}
\item The purpose of the columns and tables described here is to store
information that one can expect to arrive from a telescope.
Calibrated data will be the DATA column in a calibrated MS that is
otherwise simply a reference to the original MS (note that the UNITs
of the DATA column may therefore be different in original and
calibrated MSes). Predicted data will similarly show up as a DATA
column in an MS.

\item There is only one subtable of each type and
that is stored as a keyword of the table. This simplifies selection since
it can be done on a table (e.g. SOURCE NAME is '3C84') and the keys then
used to select from the main table.

\item We want to keep as many columns as possible common to both
Single Dish and Synthesis. Furthermore, we regard most of the columns
identified here as required. It simplifies code tremendously and the
Miriad storage manager avoids significant disk space usage. However,
we have identified a couple of cases where following these guidelines
would result in too much wasted storage and introduced some optional
columns to cope with this (e.g., FLOAT\_DATA for single dish).

\item The model is that each ANTENNA has an unrestricted number of FEEDs.
For each FEED there are some RECEPTORS, probably one per polarization state
(e.g. R and L or X and Y). A number of SPECTRAL\_WINDOW setups are allowed.
Different setups are expected in different rows of the Main table.
Thus, for example, different VLA IFs show up as different rows.

\item We think that PHASED\_ANTENNAS and PHASED\_FEEDS table will be needed
but since these are quite specialized, we have refrained from specifying
contents. We think that these should be implemented first as TELESCOPE specific
tables (e.g. NRAO\_GBT\_FEEDARRAY) and then a common format agreed upon.
Such tables should probably index into the ANTENNA and FEED tables to get
information.

\item The SOURCE table contains information that is often not present
in on-line formats, therefore we have made the use of the table
optional. It could be added during later processing to organize the 
data by source. The FIELD table is the place to describe pointings.

\item The CORRELATOR table is still unspecified. Instruments like the
VLBA will require it, but at present it will usually be empty.

\item The PULSAR table appears to be very telescope specific so we haven't
described any format. Perhaps this possibility would provide a good impetus
for the pulsar community to make common cause. 

\item Non-standard information may be added in various ways as per Bob
Garwood's proposal:
\begin{itemize}
\item As a new column in an existing table e.g. NS\_NRAO\_GBT\_WHATEVER
\item As an e.g. NRAO-approved column NRAO\_GBT\_WHATEVER or NRAO\_WHATEVER
\item As a Project approved column WHATEVER.
\end{itemize}

\item Units and Measures. All columns representing physical quantities
should be specified in the correct units, as specified in the table
descriptions. Columns representing \aipspp Measures should have a
MEASURE keyword giving the \aipspp Measure name minus the initial 'M'
(e.g., DIRECTION or EPOCH) and a MEASURE\_REFERENCE keyword giving the 
Measure enum type as a String (e.g., "J2000" or "UTC")

\end{itemize}


\section{MeasurementSet classes}
\par
The MeasurementSet is coded as a series of related classes. Each
subtable follows the same basic scheme as the MAIN table. 
The namespace in each table is separate. For each
(sub)table there is a separate class which provides various conversion
and inquiry functions for the columns and keywords and defines the
required set of columns and keywords. The main MeasumentSet class
provides access to the subtables via these classes.  E.g.,
MeasurementSet has a member function antenna() which gives access to
the ANTENNA subtable. More detailed documentation on these classes can
be found in the on-line documentation 
(directory: code/trial/implement/MeasurementSet).

The definite descriptions of the MS tables are contained within the
\aipspp class documentation files in the MeasurementSet
module. For each of the MeasurementSet
tables there is a file (e.g. MSMainEnums.html, MSAntennaEnums.html) giving
a description for the enum name (e.g., DATA, POSITION) used for a
particular column or keyword.  
Examples on how to use these classes to write a filler for a
particular instrument can be found by looking at existing fillers,
e.g., uvfitsfiller.

\clearpage
\section{MS layout}

There is a MAIN table containing a number of data columns and keys
into various subtables. There is at most one of each subtable. The
subtables are stored as keywords of the MS.

\hline
\end{tabular}

\par
Note that there are two types of subtables. For the first, simpler
type, the key (ID) is the row number in the subtable. 
Examples are ARRAY, FIELD, SPECTRAL\_WINDOW, OBSERVATION
and CORRELATOR. For the second, the key is a collection of parameters,
usually including TIME. Examples are ANTENNA, FEED, SOURCE, SYSCAL, WEATHER.
We think the Calabretta interpolation test is a good one: CORRELATOR
setups cannot be sensibly interpolated and thus a different ID
is required for each setup. For the interpolable tables, one needs
to decide what value is actually to be used. We think this belongs in
access routines independent of the MS.

\par
Notes: 
\begin{itemize}
\item All ID columns are zero-based, a value of -1 indicates that
there is no corresponding subtable present. 
\item All required columns
should be filled with suitable defaults if not actually used. 
\item For time dependent tables, a value of DBL\_MAX (defined by including
aips/Mathematics/Constants.h) for interval can be used to
specify non time dependent entries.
\item The layout of the CORRELATOR and FLAGGING\_LOG table is currently
unspecified. We need to gain some experience with specific
implementations of these before specifying a general format.

\item[ANTENNA1, ANTENNA2] For Single dish ANTENNA1=ANTENNA2
\item[PULSAR\_BIN] For a pulsar the correlations are assumed to be measured for a
limited number of pulse phase bins. This is the particular bin for which this data was measured.

of feed-arrays, i.e., multiple simultaneous beams on the sky at the
same frequency and polarization. 
\item[SPECTRAL\_WINDOW\_ID] A value of -1 indicates the row is
valid for all spectral windows.

To get the meaning of the values (0 or 1), see the POLARIZATION\_TYPE
in the FEED table. An example would
be (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) for all correlations between whatever

        (the frequency resolution of each channel), this

        The Vector nature allows for variable-width channels.
